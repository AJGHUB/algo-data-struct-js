Debugging notes:

node --inspect-brk "filename".js

Found a solution at, 
"https://github.com/nodejs/node-inspect/issues/48", instead of

node inspect index.js

open 2 terminals, in the first

node --inspect-brk index.js

then in the second

node inspect localhost:9229



If you use Visual Studio Code it's better to use it's built in debugger.

1. set breakpoints by clicking to the left of the code line number to set a red dot.

2. Debug > Start Debugging or just press the 'F5' key. 

3. you can type javascript commands at the bottom '>' prompt.
